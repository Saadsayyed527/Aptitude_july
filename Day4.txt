Classification - Theory and Explanation (Easy Level - Day 1)
What is Classification?
Classification is a method of grouping objects, words, or concepts based on their common properties. In aptitude tests, classification questions test your ability to recognize patterns and categorize elements correctly.

Types of Classification
Based on Similarity – Choosing the odd one out from a group of similar objects.

Example: Apple, Banana, Orange, Chair (Chair is the odd one because the rest are fruits).
Based on Numbers – Finding the number that doesn’t fit in a pattern.

Example: 11, 13, 17, 19, 22 (22 is the odd one because the rest are prime numbers).
Based on Letters/Words – Identifying the word or letter that does not belong.

Example: A, E, I, O, X (X is the odd one because the rest are vowels).
Based on Professions – Finding the one that does not match a certain profession.

Example: Doctor, Nurse, Engineer, Stethoscope (Stethoscope is an object, the rest are professions).
Based on Animals, Plants, or Objects – Identifying the one that doesn’t fit.

Example: Lion, Tiger, Elephant, Shark (Shark is the odd one because the rest are land animals).
