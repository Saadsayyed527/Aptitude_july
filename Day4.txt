Classification - Theory & 30 Easy Questions for Placement Aptitude
ðŸ”¹ What is Classification in Aptitude?
Classification is a type of reasoning where objects, words, numbers, or concepts are grouped based on a common property. The goal is to find the odd one out from a given set of options.

This topic tests logical thinking, pattern recognition, and decision-making skills, which are crucial for placement exams and competitive tests.

ðŸ”¹ Types of Classification Questions
Based on Common Characteristics

Identifying the word/number/object that does not belong to the group.
Example: Apple, Banana, Orange, Chair (Chair is the odd one out because it's not a fruit).
Based on Numbers & Mathematical Patterns

Finding the number that does not follow the same numerical pattern.
Example: 3, 5, 7, 8, 11 (8 is not a prime number).
Based on Letter/Word Relationships

Identifying the word or letter that does not fit the given relationship.
Example: A, E, I, O, X (X is not a vowel).
Based on Professions or Objects

Finding an element that does not belong to a group of professions or tools.
Example: Doctor, Teacher, Engineer, Telescope (Telescope is an object, not a profession).
Based on Living vs. Non-Living Objects

Distinguishing between animals, plants, and inanimate objects.
Example: Lion, Tiger, Elephant, Table (Table is non-living).
ðŸ”¹ How to Solve Classification Questions?
Identify the Common Property:

Look for a shared feature in most options.
Find the Odd One Out:

Identify the option that does not share this property.
Check for Hidden Patterns:

Some classifications involve numerical or logical sequences.
Use Elimination Method:

If confused, eliminate obvious wrong choices first.
